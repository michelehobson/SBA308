Readme

JavaScript Requirements Met:
 1. Only used let and const to declare variables.
 2. Used operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.
 3. Cached strings, number, and most boolean values in variables (Exception was a couple of return statements).
 4. Included multiple if/else statements.
 5. Included try/catch statements and although I would code it appropriately for user input, I checked each field to ensure it was numeric.
 6. Coded multiple for loops, and one for in.
 7. Used one break statement to stop processing if a future due date was detected.
 8. Created the array, 'learner'.
 9. Loaded, cleared, iterated, and read learner.
10. Created functions checkForOverdue() and findFutureDueDates() to handle repetitive tasks.
11. Outputted requested data. Scores are displayed as a percentages.
12. No errors detected.
13. 16+ commits.
14. Readme

Extras:

2. Added an alert that is triggered if the user enters a due date that is five years from the current date.
3. Ensured values were entered for CourseInfo and AssignmentGroup name fields.
4. Created a helper function to validate input
5. Added logic to use possible points in overall average calculation from missed exams.
